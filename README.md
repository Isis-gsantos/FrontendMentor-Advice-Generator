## Project Description :bulb:
The project is a challenge from Frontend Mentor, who designed the layout and challenged me to use an advice generator API. <br>
When clicking the button, the API data must be retrieved, such as the council id and the council description, thus appearing the council on the user's screen. The site has responsive design. <br>
This exercise was great, it challenged me to use another fun API and helped me improve my knowledge of JavaScript.
